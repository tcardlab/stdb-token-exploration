## Exploration Into Invalid Token Handling

This repo demonstrates some uncertainties around handling invalid tokens.
I have confirmed equivalent behavior between [v0.10.0](../../tree/v0.10.0) and [v0.11.0](../../tree/v0.11.0).

Main branch is minimally functional, it doesn't have anything interesting on it.

For each branch you will have to run the following to change the dependencies:
```sh
npm i
npm start
```
